
Blueprint: Regex‑Based File Renamer in Python

1. Define the User Inputs

Decide what your tool needs from the user:

    - A directory path to scan
    - A regex pattern to search for
    - A replacement pattern (e.g., using capture groups)
    - Optional flags:
    - Case sensitivity
    - Recursive search
    - Dry‑run mode
    - Preview limit

This is the “interface” of your tool.

2. Collect the Target Files

Plan how your script will gather files:

    - Validate the directory exists
    - List files (or walk subdirectories if recursive)
    - Filter out directories vs files
    - Optionally filter by extension

This stage is about building a clean list of candidates.

3. Apply the Regex Pattern

For each filename:

    - Test whether it matches the regex
    - Extract capture groups if needed
    - Build the new filename using the replacement pattern
    - Skip files that don’t match

This is the transformation logic.

4. Preview the Changes

Before renaming anything:

    - Show the user a list of old_name → new_name
    - Highlight collisions (two files mapping to the same new name)
    - Highlight invalid filenames
    - Respect dry‑run mode

This step protects you from accidental damage.

5. Handle Edge Cases

Plan for:

    - Name collisions
    - Files that already have the target name
    - Illegal characters (Windows especially)
    - Very long paths
    - Regex errors
    - Permission issues

This is where robustness comes from.

6. Perform the Rename Operation

If the user confirms:

    - Rename each file
    - Log successes and failures
    - Optionally create a rollback log (old → new)

This is the execution phase.

7. Optional Enhancements

If you want to stretch your skills:

    - Add a GUI (Tkinter)
    - Add undo support using a JSON log
    - Add batch presets for common patterns
    - Add unit tests for your regex logic
    - Add CLI arguments with argparse or click
    - Add logging with verbosity levels
